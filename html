    <h2>Welcome to my profile👋 I am a French developer specializing in Brainfuck. Some people might think this language is useless, but Brainfuck was the first programming language I learned. Looking back, it might seem like a somewhat silly start to my journey… 🫠 something that might make some people give up quickly. Fortunately, I know other languages: Python, Batch. Of course, I have basic knowledge in many programming languages: JavaScript, C, C++, C#, PHP, CSS, TypeScript, HTML, Go, Rust, Lua, Ruby… (There are more) and i'm still on version 5.1 of SQL 😵‍💫. I am very active on Discord and I enjoy helping people. :)</h2>
